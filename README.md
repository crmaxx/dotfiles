my dotfiles
===========

Requirements
------------

Set zsh as your login shell.

    chsh -s /bin/zsh

Install
-------

Clone onto your laptop:

    git clone git://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles.git

(Or, [fork and keep your fork
updated](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/5133345960)).

Install:

    cd dotfiles
    ./install.sh

This will create symlinks for config files in your home directory.

You can safely run `./install.sh` multiple times to update.
